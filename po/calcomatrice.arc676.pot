"Calcomatrice is a matrix calculator application. You can work with matrices "
"of any size. Matrices can be saved in memory for later use under any name "
"that starts with a letter; each matrix must have a unique name. Matrices are "
"written to disk when the app exits and are restored on app launch. Clear the "
"memory from the memory view to delete the saved matrices."

"Use <b>+</b>, <b>-</b> to add or subtract matrices. Use <b>×</b> to multiply "
"matrices together. Scalar multiplication uses <b>•</b> and the scalar must "
"precede the matrix. The caret <b>^</b> represents matrix powers; the matrix "
"must precede the power. If a digit follows the minus operator, these will be "
"parsed together as a negative number. To subtract an expression starting "
"with a digit, add that expression using the opposite number (e.g. to compute "
"<i>A - 2B</i>, write <b>A + -2 • B</b>)."

"In portrait mode, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access matrix "
"memory and additional matrix functions. Tap the arrow button to dismiss the "
"extended panel. From the extended panel, tap the name of a matrix to add it "
"to the formula. This will automatically dismiss the panel. Adding functions "
"to the formula will not dismiss the panel. Remember to add the closing "
"parentheses to close off any used functions. In landscape mode, the extended "
"input panel with all inputs is always visible. The additional functions "
"compute the matrix inverse, the determinant, the matrix of minors or "
"cofactors, the transpose, and the identity matrix of the provided size. The "
"matrix inverse, matrix of minors, and matrix of cofactors are only defined "
"for square matrices. The identity matrix function takes an integer as its "
"argument. The other two functions can take any matrix as their argument. "
"Note that the determinant of a nonsquare matrix is always zero. Also note "
"that the determinant is represented internally as a 1x1 matrix and the "
"output of the determinant function cannot be used as a scalar in formulas."
