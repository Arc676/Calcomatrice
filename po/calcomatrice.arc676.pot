"In portrait mode, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access matrix "
"memory and additional matrix functions. Remember to add the closing "
"parentheses to close off any used functions. In landscape mode, the extended "
"input panel with all inputs is always visible. The additional functions "
"compute the matrix inverse, the determinant, the matrix of minors or "
"cofactors, the transpose, and the identity matrix of the provided size. The "
"matrix inverse, matrix of minors, and matrix of cofactors are only defined "
"for square matrices. The identity matrix function takes an integer as its "
"argument. The other two functions can take any matrix as their argument. "
"Note that the determinant of a nonsquare matrix is always zero."
